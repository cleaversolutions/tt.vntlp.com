This is the Jekyll source code for a little test project I am playing around with creating super-fast, tiny, micro websites.

## The Problem

I was tired of going to events (usually outdoors), trying to go to the event website on my phone, and the website would never load. This happens for three reasons:

1. Because everyone trying to access the event website is at the event, everyone is working off of the same cell phone data networks and overloading the networks, making transfer speed super-slow.
2. For people at the event just looking for information, the websites are overly complicated. Fancy images and graphics lead to huge amounts of data that have to be transferred for the website to load. Since everyone is already overloading the data network, it takes forever to load a web page and sometimes pages may not load at all.
3. Sometimes, the website can't handle all the traffic at once and the website itself crashes.

So I thought I would conduct an experiment to see if I could solve these problems. I wanted to build informational event webpages that:

1. Have only the required information on them. Anything that isn't necessary is thrown out.
2. Would be built in such a way as to maximize page load speeds.
3. Are viral-proof. Regardless of how many people try to access the page, the website server has to be able to serve it quickly without possibility of crashing.

This website, vntlnp.com ("event lineup", vowels removed), is that experiment. You are reading one of the fastest, most viral-proof webpages in the world. In an age where flashy is in, most businesses forget one very important thing: it doesn't matter how pretty it is if the website won't load.
